For example, consider a homework assignment due Tuesday night. If you have one late day remaining you may turn in that assignment on Thursday night, which would use your last late day and also receive a 10% penalty. If you have no late days remaining you may still turn in that assignment Thursday night, but it would receive a 20% penalty. Work turned in Friday night (3 days late) would receive no credit regardless of how many late days you have remaining; we only accept work two days late no matter how many late days you have.
